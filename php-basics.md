1. **Variables**: Used to store data, like numbers, strings, or arrays. In PHP, a variable is declared with a `$` sign, e.g., `$variableName`.

   ```php
   $name = "John Doe";
   echo $name;
   ```




2. **Data Types**: Basic types of data PHP can handle, including:
   - Integers
   - Floats (or doubles)
   - Strings
   - Booleans
   - Arrays
   - Objects
   - NULL
   - Resources
  
   - Integer
     ```php
     $intVar = 10;
     echo $intVar;
     ```
   - Float
     ```php
     $floatVar = 10.5;
     echo $floatVar;
     ```
   - String
     ```php
     $stringVar = "Hello World";
     echo $stringVar;
     ```
   - Boolean
     ```php
     $boolVar = true;
     echo $boolVar;
     ```
   - Array
     ```php
     $arrayVar = array(1, 2, 3);
     print_r($arrayVar);
     ```
   - Object
     ```php
     class Car {
         public $color = "red";
     }
     $carObj = new Car();
     echo $carObj->color;
     ```
   - NULL
     ```php
     $nullVar = NULL;
     var_dump($nullVar);
     ```
   - Resource
     ```php
     $file = fopen("test.txt", "r");
     var_dump($file);
     ```

3. **Arrays**: A complex data type that can hold multiple values in one single variable. There are three types of arrays: indexed arrays, associative arrays, and multidimensional arrays.


   ```php
   $fruits = array("apple", "banana", "cherry");
   echo $fruits[1]; // Outputs "banana"
   ```

4. **Constants**: Similar to variables but their value does not change during the execution of a script. Defined using the `define()` function or the `const` keyword.

   ```php
   define("SITE_URL", "https://example.com/");
   echo SITE_URL;
   ```

5. **Loops**: Structures used to repeat a series of instructions until a certain condition is met. Types of loops in PHP include:
   - `for` loop
   - `while` loop
   - `do-while` loop
   - `foreach` loop (specifically for arrays)

   - `for` loop
     ```php
     for ($i = 0; $i < 3; $i++) {
         echo $i . " ";
     }
     ```
   - `while` loop
     ```php
     $i = 0;
     while ($i < 3) {
         echo $i . " ";
         $i++;
     }
     ```
   - `do-while` loop
     ```php
     $i = 0;
     do {
         echo $i . " ";
         $i++;
     } while ($i < 3);
     ```
   - `foreach` loop
     ```php
     foreach ($fruits as $fruit) {
         echo $fruit . " ";
     }
     ```  

6. **Conditional Statements**: Used to perform different actions based on different conditions. These include:
   - `if` statement
   - `else` statement
   - `elseif` statement
   - `switch` statement

   - `if` statement
     ```php
     if ($i < 3) {
         echo "i is less than 3";
     }
     ```
   - `else` statement
     ```php
     if ($i < 3) {
         echo "i is less than 3";
     } else {
         echo "i is 3 or more";
     }
     ```
   - `elseif` statement
     ```php
     if ($i < 3) {
         echo "i is less than 3";
     } elseif ($i == 3) {
         echo "i is 3";
     } else {
         echo "i is greater than 3";
     }
     ```
   - `switch` statement
     ```php
     switch ($i) {
         case 0:
             echo "i is 0";
             break;
         case 1:
             echo "i is 1";
             break;
         default:
             echo "i is neither 0 nor 1";
     }
     ```

7. **Functions**: Blocks of code that can be repeatedly called. PHP has built-in functions and also allows for user-defined functions.

  ```php
   function sayHello($name) {
       return "Hello, $name!";
   }
   echo sayHello("John");
   ```

8. **Classes/Objects**: PHP is an object-oriented language, so you can define classes and create objects. A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

  ```php
   class Person {
       public $name;
       public function sayHello() {
           return "Hello, I'm " . $this->name;
       }
   }
   $person = new Person();
   $person->name = "John";
   echo $person->sayHello();
   ```

9. **Inheritance**: A feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit the properties and methods of another class.

   ```php
   class Employee extends Person {
       public $jobTitle;
   }
   $employee = new Employee();
   $employee->name = "Jane";
   $employee->jobTitle = "Web Developer";
   echo $employee->sayHello() . " and I am a " . $employee->jobTitle;
   ```

10. **Interfaces and Traits**: Used in object-oriented programming for defining abstract methods and for code reuse, respectively.

      - Interface
      ```php
      interface Greeter {
          public function greet();
      }
      class EnglishSpeaker implements Greeter {
          public function greet() {
              return "Hello";
          }
      }
      $speaker = new EnglishSpeaker();
      echo $speaker->greet();
      ```
    - Trait
      ```php
      trait Logger {
          public function log($message) {
              echo "Logging: $message";
          }
      }
      class Application {
          use Logger;
      }
      $app = new Application();
      $app->log("This is a log message.");
      ```

11. **Error Handling**: PHP provides ways to handle errors gracefully. Common error handling mechanisms are using `try-catch` blocks and setting error handlers.

 ```php
    try {
        // Code that may throw an exception
        throw new Exception("Something went wrong.");
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
    }
  ```

12. **Namespaces**: A way of encapsulating items like classes, interfaces, functions, and constants to avoid name conflicts.

    ```php
    namespace MyProject;
    use MyProject\Utils\Helper;

    class MyClass {
        // Class code here
    }
    ```

13. **Global Variables - Superglobals**: Built-in variables that are always available in all scopes, like `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_SESSION`, `$_COOKIE`, `$_SERVER`, etc.

    ```php
    echo $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'];
    ```

14. **File Inclusion**: Using statements like `include`, `require`, `include_once`, and `require_once` to include and execute PHP code from other files.

    - Using `include`
      ```php
      // This will include the file 'header.php'
      include 'header.php';
      ```
